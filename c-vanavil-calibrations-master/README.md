# Vanavil Calibration Website Project

This document outlines the development of the Vanavil Calibration website, a project undertaken by **INNAK** in collaboration with **NEXGENNEXTOPIA**.



## Overview

**Vanavil Calibration** specializes in calibration, validation, and hardware equipment services. To enhance their online presence, **INNAK** has been entrusted with designing and developing their official website.



## Involved Entities

1. **Vanavil Calibration**:  
   The client company for whom the website is being developed.

2. **NEXGENNEXTOPIA**:  
   A partner organization that facilitated the project transfer to INNAK and provided the initial project template and development guidelines.

3. **INNAK**:  
   The primary entity responsible for the design, development, and delivery of the website.



## Project Details

- **Template Source**:  
  The website template was procured from [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/).

- **Template Name**:  
  *Mediic - Medical, Hospital, and Clinic HTML5 Template*

- **Development Scope**:  
  The project scope includes:
  1. A **refined website** built upon the purchased template, customized to Vanavil Calibrationâ€™s branding and functional requirements.
  2. Integration of **Google Apps Script** to handle Google Form submissions seamlessly through the website.



## Legal Considerations

   Vanavil Calibration retains full ownership of the final website. The purchased template remains licensed under Envato Elements' terms of use.

2. **Confidentiality**:  
   INNAK agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all information, materials, and assets provided by Vanavil Calibration, ensuring their use solely for the purpose of this project.

3. **Liability**:  
   INNAK will be responsible for resolving issues caused by internal faults in the development or integration processes. However, INNAK shall not be held liable for external factors beyond its control, such as hosting provider failures, third-party service disruptions, or unauthorized changes made to the website post-handover.

4. **Payment Terms**:  
   The project cost and payment milestones have been agreed upon separately. Any additional work or features beyond the agreed scope will incur extra charges and will require mutual agreement.

5. **Support**:  
   INNAK provides **6 months of free support post-launch** to address minor bug fixes and small changes. Major feature requests or significant updates outside the scope of minor fixes will be discussed and handled separately.
